    "#### 1️⃣ TransformerLens: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is designed to get you up to speed with the TransformerLens library. You'll learn how to load and run models, and learn about the shared architecture template for all of these models (the latter of which should be familiar to you if you've already done the exercises that come before these, since many of the same design principles are followed).\n",

    "> - Load and run a `HookedTransformer` model\n",
    "> - Understand the basic architecture of these models\n",
    "> - Use the model's tokenizer to convert text to tokens, and vice versa\n",
    "> - Know how to cache activations, and to access activations from the cache\n",

    "#### 2️⃣ Find Inductive Heads via attention patterns\n",

    "*Note - this intro is written from the POV of Neel Nanda.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a demo notebook for [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens), **a library I ([Neel Nanda](https://www.neelnanda.io/)) wrote for doing [mechanistic interpretability](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) of GPT-2 Style language models.** The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights. It is a fact about the world today that we have computer programs that can essentially speak English at a human level (GPT-3, PaLM, etc), yet we have no idea how they work nor how to write one ourselves. This offends me greatly, and I would like to solve this! Mechanistic interpretability is a very young and small field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **Check out my [list of concrete open problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WONBzNqfKIxERejrrPlQMyKqg7jSFW92x5UMXNrMdPo/edit#) to figure out where to start.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote this library because after I left the Anthropic interpretability team and started doing independent research, I got extremely frustrated by the state of open source tooling. There's a lot of excellent infrastructure like HuggingFace and DeepSpeed to *use* or *train* models, but very little to dig into their internals and reverse engineer how they work. **This library tries to solve that**, and to make it easy to get into the field even if you don't work at an industry org with real infrastructure! The core features were heavily inspired by [Anthropic's excellent Garcon tool](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html). Credit to Nelson Elhage and Chris Olah for building Garcon and showing me the value of good infrastructure for accelerating exploratory research!\n",
    "\n",
    "The core design principle I've followed is to enable exploratory analysis - one of the most fun parts of mechanistic interpretability compared to normal ML is the extremely short feedback loops! The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state. This notebook demonstrates how the library works and how to use it, but if you want to see how well it works for exploratory research, check out [my notebook analysing Indirect Objection Identification](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/main/Exploratory_Analysis_Demo.ipynb) or [my recording of myself doing research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo4QvDn-vsU)!\n",

    "    * We can think of these values as only existing for the duration of a single forward pass, and disappearing afterwards.\n",
    "    * We can use hooks to access these values during a forward pass (more on hooks later), but it doesn't make sense to talk about a model's activations outside the context of some particular input.\n",
    "    * Attention scores and patterns are activations (this is slightly non-intuitve because they're used in a matrix multiplication with another activation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The link below shows a diagram of a single layer (called a `TransformerBlock`) for an attention-only model with no biases. Each box corresponds to an **activation** (and also tells you the name of the corresponding hook point, which we will eventually use to access those activations). The red text below each box tells you the shape of the activation (ignoring the batch dimension). Each arrow corresponds to an operation on an activation; where there are **parameters** involved these are labelled on the arrows.\n",

    "    * But an easier way is just to index with `model.W_Q`, which gives you the `[nlayers, nheads, d_model, d_head]` tensor containing **every** query weight in the model.\n",
    "* Similarly, there exist shortcuts `model.W_E`, `model.W_U` and `model.W_pos` for the embeddings, unembeddings and positional embeddings respectively.\n",
    "* With models containing MLP layers, you also have `model.W_in` and `model.W_out` for the linear layers.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "The tokenizer is stored inside the model, and you can access it using `model.tokenizer`. There are also a few helper methods that call the tokenizer under the hood, for instance:\n",

    "TransformerLens appends this token by default, and it can easily trip up new users. Notably, **this includes** `model.forward` (which is what's implicitly used when you do eg `model(\"Hello World\")`). You can disable this behaviour by setting the flag `prepend_bos=False` in `to_tokens`, `to_str_tokens`, `model.forward` and any other function that converts strings to multi-token tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "`prepend_bos` is a bit of a hack, and I've gone back and forth on what the correct default here is. The reason I do this is that transformers tend to treat the first token weirdly - this doesn't really matter in training (where all inputs are >1000 tokens), but this can be a big issue when investigating short prompts! The reason for this is that attention patterns are a probability distribution and so need to add up to one, so to simulate being \"off\" they normally look at the first token. Giving them a BOS token lets the heads rest by looking at that, preserving the information in the first \"real\" token.\n",
    "\n",

Everything else (the residual stream, keys, queries, values, etc) are compressed intermediate states when calculating meaningful things. So a natural place to start is classifying heads by their attention patterns on various texts.\n",

    "Let's say that our model knows that the token Harry is followed by the token Potter, and we want to figure out how it does this. The logits on Harry are `residual @ W_U`.

So `logits = (embed @ W_U) + (attn_out @ W_U) + (attn_out_1 @ W_U)`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can be even more specific, and *just* look at the logit of the Potter token - this corresponds to a column of `W_U`, and so a direction in the residual stream - our logit is now a single number that is the sum of `(embed @ potter_U) + (attn_out_0 @ potter_U) + (attn_out_1 @ potter_U)`. Even better, we can decompose each attention layer output into the sum of the result of each head, and use this to get many terms.\n",

    "* By looking at just the logits corresponding to the correct token, our data is much lower dimensional because we can ignore all other tokens other than the correct next one (Dealing with a 50K vocab size is a pain!). But this comes at the cost of missing out on more subtle effects, like a head suppressing other plausible logits, to increase the log prob of the correct one.\n",
    "    * There are other situations where our job might be easier. For instance, in the IOI task (which we'll discuss shortly) we're just comparing the logits of the indirect object to the logits of the direct object, meaning we can use the **difference between these logits**, and ignore all the other logits.\n",
    "* When calculating correct output logits, we will get tensors with a dimension `(position - 1,)`, not `(position,)` - we remove the final element of the output (logits), and the first element of labels (tokens). This is because we're predicting the *next* token, and we don't know the token after the final token, so we ignore it.\n",

    "To do do logit atribution, we first need hooks\n",
    "## What are hooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great things about interpreting neural networks is that we have *full control* over our system. From a computational perspective, we know exactly what operations are going on inside (even if we don't know what they mean!). And we can make precise, surgical edits and see how the model's behaviour and other internals change. This is an extremely powerful tool, because it can let us e.g. set up careful counterfactuals and causal intervention to easily understand model behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, being able to do this is a pretty core operation, and this is one of the main things TransformerLens supports! The key feature here is **hook points**. Every activation inside the transformer is surrounded by a hook point, which allows us to edit or intervene on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by adding a **hook function** to that activation, and then calling `model.run_with_hooks`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Terminology note - because basically all the activations in our model have an associated hook point, we'll sometimes use the terms \"hook\" and \"activation\" interchangeably.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hook functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Hook functions take two arguments: `activation_value` and `hook_point`. The `activation_value` is a tensor representing some activation in the model, just like the values in our `ActivationCache`. The `hook_point` is an object which gives us methods like `hook.layer()` or attributes like `hook.name` that are sometimes useful to call within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're using hooks to edit activations, then the hook function should return a tensor of the same shape as the activation value. But we can also just have our hook function access the activation, do some processing, and write the results to some external variable (in which case our hook function should just not return anything).\n",

    "<summary>Relationship to PyTorch hooks</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyTorch hooks](https://blog.paperspace.com/pytorch-hooks-gradient-clipping-debugging/) are a great and underrated, yet incredibly janky, feature. They can act on a layer, and edit the input or output of that layer, or the gradient when applying autodiff. The key difference is that **Hook points** act on *activations* not layers. This means that you can intervene within a layer on each activation, and don't need to care about the precise layer structure of the transformer. And it's immediately clear exactly how the hook's effect is applied. This adjustment was shamelessly inspired by [Garcon's use of ProbePoints](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "They also come with a range of other quality of life improvements. PyTorch's hooks are global state, which can be a massive pain if you accidentally leave a hook on a model. TransformerLens hooks are also global state, but `run_with_hooks` tries to create an abstraction where these are local state by removing all hooks at the end of the function (and they come with a helpful `model.reset_hooks()` method to remove all hooks).\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>How are TransformerLens hooks actually implemented?</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "They are implemented as modules with the identity function as their forward method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class HookPoint(nn.Module):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    def forward(self, x):\n",
    "        return x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "but also with special features for adding and removing hook functions. This is why you see hooks when you print a HookedTransformer model, because all its modules are recursively printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the model normally, hook modules won't change the model's behaviour (since applying the identity function does nothing). It's only once you add functions to the hook modules (e.g. a function which ablates any inputs into the hook module) that the model's behaviour changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hooks: Accessing Activations\n",
    "\n",
    "In later sections, we'll write some code to intervene on hooks, which is really the core feature that makes them so useful for interpretability. But for now, let's just look at how to access them without changing their value. This can be achieved by having the hook function write to a global variable, and return nothing (rather than modifying the activation in place).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why might we want to do this? It turns out to be useful for things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extracting activations for a specific task\n",
    "* Doing some long-running calculation across many inputs, e.g. finding the text that most activates a specific neuron\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, in theory, this could all be done using the `run_with_cache` function we used in the previous section, combined with post-processing of the cache result. But using hooks can be more intuitive and memory efficient.\n",

    "You should find that the most variation in the logit attribution comes from the direct path. In particular, some of the tokens in the direct path have a very high logit attribution (e.g. tokens 12, 24 and 46). Can you guess what gives them in particular such a high logit attribution? \n",

    "\n",
    "The tokens with very high logit attribution are the ones which \"offer very probable bigrams\". For instance, the highest contribution on the direct path comes from `| manip|`, because this is very likely to be followed by `|ulative|` (or presumably a different stem like `| ulation|`). `| super|` -> `|human|` is another example of a bigram formed when the tokenizer splits one word into multiple tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also examples that come from two different words, rather than a single word split by the tokenizer. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `| more|` -> `| likely|`\n",
    "* `| machine|` -> `| learning|`\n",
    "* `| by|` -> `| default|`\n",

    "This is because of a point we discussed earlier - this plot doesn't pick up on things like a head's effect in composition with another head. So the attribution for layer-0 heads won't involve any composition, whereas the attributions for layer-1 heads will involve not only the single-head paths through those attention heads, but also the 2-layer compositional paths through heads in layer 0 and layer 1.\n",
